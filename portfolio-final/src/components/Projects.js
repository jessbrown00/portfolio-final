      "Catching the bus in Hobart isn’t anything special. The City of Hobart intend to fix that with the Connected Hobart Initiative, redesigning bus shelters as digital experiences. The initiative should improve accessibility, communicate information clearly and intuitively, create a more enjoyable bus-riding experience and foster a more connected community. ",

      "The design solution was informed by thorough research into smart public transport, and multiple rounds of user testing and interviewing. User groups (residents, commuters and tourists) revealed some key pain points, and features that were important to them such as a live bus tracker, visually interesting shelter design and knowing exactly when to get off the bus.

    interaction_1_body:
      "Catch uses a distilled UI to guide the user directly to the correct bus information. Users input their start and end destinations and what time they want to leave, and Catch gives them a personalised and live bus tracker with a clear indicator of when the next bus arrives. Users can manually edit this information, share their tracker to contacts or update important bus information, like hailing the bus, choosing a later time or requesting ramp access. ",

Full screen colour coding lets you know the status of your trip at a glance, and only the most important information is displayed visually for ease of use in a rush. Users can disable or exit this mode at any time. ",

    interaction_3_body:
      "By giving a community a common goal, and stakes, bonds can be formed even amongst strangers. The interactive garden, unique to every bus stop, not only gives users something to do while waiting for the bus, it creates a shared experience and a visual representation of community co-operation. Seeds are unlocked according to communal bus trips taken and the best gardens are announced every season, giving communities something to strive for and reasons to rely on each other. The garden needs constant watering and care and cannot physically be cared for by one user, so the wellbeing of the garden is a true reflection of community involvement and creates a level of stickiness that encourages the user to come back for more.

    concluding_comments:
      "The process of designing and iterating Catch has taught me how well-informed a design can be when user research is properly integrated and considered. The quick findings report I generated from my user research revealed surprising insights and informed my design from inception to completion, in both UX and aesthetic capacities. Consideration of minimal UI played a big role in how clearly I could communicate bus information, and I look forward to pushing the concept of the community garden further in the future. Gamification, customisation and establishing user communication could make this experience something really special. Stay tuned!",

",

      "At the risk of being too meta, all the assets for this project were created using the three featured programs. Mock-ups were done in Adobe Photoshop; designs were refined in Adobe Illustrator, and everything was animated in Adobe Aftereffects. Hey, I practice what I preach. I wanted to give the motion graphic it's own unique flat style without diverting from Adob'e branding.  ",

Working on my animation skills has improved my digital designs. I now find it easier to conceptualise creative interactive features, produce more polished micro-interactions and present my work in a cleaner and more polished format. I can’t wait to use animation and motion graphics more in my digital design work. ",

It was also a great way to dive into the world of web animation, something I'm interested in discovering more about. The coding experience Clink gave me has helped me better communicate with developers and expand my own front-end capabilities.   ",
